If you have Node.js on your computer, I've turned our files into a package so you can run as a node application. This is just a quick and easy work environment if you'd like to try it this way. Here is how to do so in your terminal:
- Make sure you're in the correct directory (that you cloned repo in)
- Type the command, `npm init`, hit `enter` , press enter a few times until you get the option to type 'yes' to accept the default options
- `npm start`, `enter` (this will start your local server)
- After this you'll be able to go to your browser and access the site at `http://localhost:3000/index.html` , and see changes by saving the file and refreshing the site page
-When you're finished with making changes, you can `git add .` , and then `git commit -m "describe changes here"`, and then `git push`
-To kill the server hit `CTRL C` at the terminal. You can start the server back up with `npm start` again.
